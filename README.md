# IoT_DigitalSensorModulesForArduino
Code for digital sensor modules for the Arduino. Tested on Arduino MKR1000 and will work ok on most Arduino boards.

In the beginning of the code there is a link to the sensor hardware providers page and short insructions for the hardware wiring. In most cases the hardware SPI interface on the microcontroller is used for the communication between sensor module and micro controller. SPI is one of the peripheral interface blocks on the micro controller hardware.
